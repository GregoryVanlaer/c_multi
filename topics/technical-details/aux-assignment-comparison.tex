  \frametitle{Different Meanings of Assignment}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The {\tt =} operator's meaning depends on how you use it
    \item We distinguish four cases
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Assignment at declaration
            \item Assignment between objects
            \item Assignment between pointers
            \item Assignment with references
          \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Assignment At Declaration}
  \code[font=\small,width=.95\linewidth]{assignment-declaration.cpp}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If assignment happens in the same statement as declaration,
          the copy constructor will be called.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Assignment with Objects}
  \code[font=\small,width=.95\linewidth]{assignment-objects.cpp}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using {\tt x = y} where {\tt x} and {\tt y} are of type {\tt T}
          will call {\tt T::operator =(const T\&)}
    \item No new objects get constructed
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Assignment with Pointers}
  \code[font=\small,width=.95\linewidth]{assignment-pointers.cpp}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using {\tt x = y} where {\tt x} and {\tt y} are of type {\tt T*}
          will simply copy pointers
    \item This is C++'s closest equivalent of Java's assignment
    \item {\tt q} and {\tt r} point to the same object
    \item Writing {\tt p = r} would make {\tt p} also point to the same object as {\tt q} and {\tt r}.
          {\tt bar} would remain untouched.
    \item Neither copy constructor nor {\tt Bar::operator =} is called
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Assignment with References}
  \code[font=\small,width=.95\linewidth]{assignment-references.cpp}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item When declaring a reference, immediate initialisation is mandatory (see {\tt bar5})
    \item Declaring reference is same as introducing extra name for same object
    \item {\tt bar} and {\tt bar2} are indistuingishable from each other
    \item When working with a reference, it is the same as if working with the original object
    \item {\tt bar2 = bar3} is the same as {\tt bar = bar3}: calls {\tt operator=}
    \item You cannot make a reference refer to another object. Once it refers to some object,
          it will do so until it dies.
  \end{itemize}
